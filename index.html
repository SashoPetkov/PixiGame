<!-- 
The task is to create a web application, written entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It should include a full deck of cards, that should be shuffled/randomized on each opening of the game.

When the application is loaded and the deck initiated, two cards should be drawn automatically, flipped,
so the actual cards can be seen, presented to the user, like in the below snapshot. Of course, the visuals
below are purely instructional, the design can be of your choice. Simple shapes are enough.

In addition to that, there should be a ‘draw button on the right corner of the game, that should become
active when the two cards are drawn to the user. Clicking the button should draw another card and add it
next to the cards drawn already. If the cards become more than 4. make the drawn cards disappear from
the screen, and two new cards to be drawn from the deck, taking their place. If the entire deck is drawn,
an error message can be shown to the user, asking them to restart the game, or a new deck can be initiated.

A couple notes:
- For visual guideline, you can look at the ‘black jack’ game for reference
- Drawing cards animation should resemble real-life drawing as much as possible.
- Frameworks can be of choice, but using canvas/Pixi.JS will be a great plus

- Please, follow the instructions above and send your solution within the following week as an archive or
attached in GitHub.
